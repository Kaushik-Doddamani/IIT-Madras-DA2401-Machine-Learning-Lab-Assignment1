## Best Practices:
* Keep commits atomic with meaningful messages (e.g., `feat: add Nesterov optimizer`, `fix: stable line search`).
* Please do not write all code on your local machine and push everything to GitHub on the last day. The commits in GitHub should reflect how the code has evolved during the course of the assignment.
* Collaborations and discussions with other students is strictly prohibited.
